# :robot: Reinforcement Learning Specialization


This repository contains the solutions for the courses of the [Reinforcement Learning Specialization from the University of Alberta](https://www.ualberta.ca/admissions-programs/online-courses/reinforcement-learning/index.html).

:calendar: I completed the courses in seven rough days. 

:pencil2: This is obviously against the recommended 4-6 months, but I was somewhat familiar with the basics of RL already, so the first two courses went quite easily.

:bomb: The courses are quite awesome. The reading assingments might seem a bit overwhelming, and the videos do not seem to give anything new apart from what the book covers, however, the nice visualisations help a lot in actually understanding what the book meant here and there.

:couple: Also, Marta and Adam did a very good job in explaining all the concepts.

:nut_and_bolt: The short, concise, but focused videos are also ecnouraging(much better than 20-40 min long ones, like other courses or tutorials have). 

:key: The videos being partitioned into sections is another smart choice of the creators, it really helps to have a cleaner overview. 

 :busts_in_silhouette: The occasional personal appearance in the videos of big names in RL such as Sutton and Barto themselves, David Silver, Csaba Szepesv√°ri and others explaning how reinforcement learning is applied in practice also makes the courses sooo epic.

## :warning: Disclaimer

:see_no_evil::hear_no_evil::speak_no_evil: I publish the assignments and quizes herewith, purely for reference, and by no means do I encourage anyone to copy-paste from here.

:chart_with_upwards_trend: As one may notice, the quizes are by no means perfectly solved. The coding assingments however, which I really cared about and which took a lot of time to solve, all achieved the maximum score.
